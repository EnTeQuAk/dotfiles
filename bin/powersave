# The VM subsystem, in the Linux kernel, buffers writes to files that applications perform for a period of time. This caching allows the kernel to group consecutive writes into one big write, and to generally optimize the disk IO to be the most efficient. The kernel, by default, will start writing out data to disk after 5 seconds, so, if a power failure or kernel crash happens, at most, 5 seconds of data would be lost.

# hal is a core component of the various desktop environments and deals with all sorts of hardware interaction. One component of the hal daemon is the part where it polls the cdrom drive regularly (as often as once every two seconds!) to see if the user has inserted a CD. This is used, for example, to automatically open a new window with a file browser for the CD.

# The current generation onboard audio (often called "High Definition" or HDA) has power savings capabilities similar to AC97. The Linux ALSA drivers support these capabilities, as of version 1.0.15 of the ALSA subsystem. These are scheduled to appear in the 2.6.24 kernel.
