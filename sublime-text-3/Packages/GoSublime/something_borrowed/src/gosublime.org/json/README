This is a clone of the standard lib's "encoding/json" except for handling of anonymous fields.

Anonymous fields that are also structs are marshalled as if their fields are the containing struct's fields.

Anonymous fields that are not structs are given the name equal to their type.

No precautions are taken for any ambiguity this may cause, so be warned.
